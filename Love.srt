 Love Me Like You Do

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Ellie Goulding

2
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,540
You're the light, you're the night

3
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,420
You're the colour of my blood

4
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,170
You're the cure, you're the pain

5
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,920
You're the only thing I wanna touch

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,310
Never knew that it could mean so much,

7
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,200
so much

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,470
You're the fear, I don't care

9
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,870
'Cause I've never been so high

10
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,120
Follow me to the dark

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,510
Let me take you past our satellites

12
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,760
You can see the world you brought to life,

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,650
to life

14
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,680
So love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,180
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do

16
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:16,430
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do

17
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,830
What are you waiting for?

18
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,830
Fading in, fading out

19
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,330
On the edge of paradise

20
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:32,590
Every inch of your skin is a holy grail I've got to find

21
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:39,080
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire

22
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:45,130
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace

23
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,520
'Cause I'm not thinking straight

24
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:57,520
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more

25
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,770
What are you waiting for?

26
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:06,420
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)

27
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,320
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do

28
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:17,240
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do

29
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,130
What are you waiting for?

30
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:26,639
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)

31
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,130
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (yeah)

32
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:37,380
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do

33
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,380
What are you waiting for?

34
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:56,550
I'll let you set the pace

35
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,700
'Cause I'm not thinking straight

36
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:10,210
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more

37
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,840
What are you waiting for?

38
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,590
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)

39
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,090
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (yeah)

40
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:31,230
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do

41
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,730
What are you waiting for?

42
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:39,620
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)

43
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,770
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (oh)

44
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:51,770
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do

45
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,770
What are you waiting for?
